anaphoric-variants gives access to anaphoric variants of operators
through one macro: ANAPHORIC. The user explicitly provides a variable
name, preserving sanity, in contrast to the traditional use of an evil
implicit variable (\"IT\"). Some operators can bind additional handy
variables when explicitly requested.
