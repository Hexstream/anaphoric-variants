Project's home: https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/anaphoric-variants/


anaphoric-variants gives access to anaphoric variants of operators
through one macro: ANAPHORIC. The user explicitly provides a variable
name, preserving sanity, in contrast to the traditional use of an evil
implicit variable ("IT"). Some operators can bind additional handy
variables when explicitly requested.
